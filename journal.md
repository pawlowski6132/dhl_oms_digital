### Friday 3/8/24
Started this project today. I'm building a site to guide developers building digital OMS tools.

1. Built repository in Github
2. Built static webapp in Azure
3. Built local folder on Personal Dell / One Drive
4. Cloned the repo to that folder
5. Tested that local commit/sync gets uploaded to Azure properly.

For future projects, pay attention to the order you build the physical folder structure locally and the github repository. I build the physical folder locally and then cloned the repository locally and now I have nested folders withthe same name. It's confusing.

Today, I continue to deep-dive further into bootstrap, learning until I'm ready to begin to build a navigation home page for the DSC/AEMCE/Analystics community. I've left the Udemy videos and am looking at a playlist from Youtube: 

[Boostrap Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irfbn103AzE&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR&index=7)

1. Went through #6, Container
2. Got through 5 minutes of #7, Grid system

I had a heck of a time trouble shooting why my code wasn't displaying the columns. CoPilot didn't help. Went to Google Gemini and it found that the class name I was using (because I typed it wrong) was "background-primary" when that class name doesn't exist. It's "bg-primary"
