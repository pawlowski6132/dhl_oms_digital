### Friday 3/8/24
Started this project today. I'm building a site to guide developers building digital OMS tools.

1. Built repository in Github
2. Built static webapp in Azure
3. Built local folder on Personal Dell / One Drive
4. Cloned the repo to that folder
5. Tested that local commit/sync gets uploaded to Azure properly.
